**Week 3: React.js Fundamentals Assignment**

**Objective:**

- Apply React.js concepts learned throughout the week.
- Practice creating components, managing state, handling events, and using Tailwind CSS.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup React.js Project:**

   - Install Node.js using NVM and create a React project.
   - Create a new project folder called `react-assignment`.
   - Initialize a React app and configure Tailwind CSS.
   - Ensure the project is properly structured with organized components.

2. **Project Structure:**

   - Organize your project files with a clear folder structure, ensuring separation of concerns.

3. **Create Functional Components:**

   - Build a `Header` component that displays a title.
   - Create a `Profile` component that accepts user details (name, email) as props and displays them.
   - Implement a `Counter` component that tracks and displays count using state.

4. **Manage State with Hooks:**

   - Use React's `useState` hook to manage and update component state.
   - Add event handlers to interact with the state (e.g., increment counter, update profile info).

5. **Integrate Components in `App.js`:**

   - Import and render all the created components within `App.js`.
   - Pass necessary props and ensure proper communication between components.

6. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:**

   - Apply Tailwind utility classes to style the components.
   - Ensure the UI is visually appealing and responsive.

7. **Testing:**

   - Run the project to verify all components are working as expected.
   - Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.

8. **Documentation:**

   - Add a `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to install, run, and use the project.

9. **Submission:**

   - Push your code to your GitHub repository.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Correct implementation of React components and hooks.
- Proper use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Project structure and code organization.
- Clear and concise documentation.
- Successful testing of the components.
